  "description": "Unity's C# stateless physics library.\n\nBuilt on top of the Unity C# DOTS framework, Unity Physics is network-ready, completely customizable, and built for performance out of the box. Whether you're building the next mobile hit or a new networked multiplayer console experience, Unity Physics leverages the Burst compiler and Job system to scale across a range of hardware.",
