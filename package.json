  "description": "Unity's C# stateless physics library.\n\nBuilt on top of the Unity C# DOTS framework, Unity Physics is network-ready, completely customizable, and built for performance out of the box. Whether you're building the next mobile hit or a new networked multiplayer console experience, Unity Physics leverages the Burst compiler and Job system to scale across a range of hardware.",

    "changelog": "### Changed\n\n* Updated Burst version in use to 1.8.3\n* Debug display systems now only update when the PhysicsDebugDisplayData component is present (e.g., through the PhysicsDebugDisplayAuthoring game object component) and are only created within the editor.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Physics Debug Display for enabled Collider Edges now draws correctly if the collider scale is modified during runtime\n* Debug display systems no longer stall and instead execute their jobs asynchronously\n* Debug draw of collider faces and AABBs now account for uniform scaling of the rigid body\n* Rigidbody components that move in PlayMode will now correctly snap back to their original position when exiting PlayMode while the containing sub scene is open for editing. As part of the fix, the classic PhysX-based physics simulation is now temporarily and globally disabled while in PlayMode with an open sub scene that contains classic Rigidbody authoring components. The Unity Physics-based physics simulation is unaffected during that time."
